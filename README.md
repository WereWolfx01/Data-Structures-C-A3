I was given an extention for this assignment by Kremer until Wednesday night. 

Running the program will first generate all the array and trees, which takes about ~6 minutes on my laptop. 
after all the generation, you'll be prompted with an output "> " through a loop, so the only way to exit the program is to type "exit". 
Only when "exit" is given the program will free all the mallocs.
