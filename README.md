Find movies by a specific actor, or find all actots from a specefic movie. 

This application takes data from the official IMDB website https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ ~1 million+ of movies and actors 
and generates a datat structure as a tree

./a3 /home/courses/cis2520    <- Command to run the program

Running the program will first generate all the array and trees, which takes about ~6 minutes on my laptop.
after all the generation, you'll be prompted with an output "> " through a loop, so the only way to exit the program is to type "exit".
Only when "exit" is given the program will free all the mallocs.
